# porth
A simple secure tcp port redirector.

The idea is simple:
Let’s say that you want to access the database of a client from your laptop and you don’t have access to the client’s router/firewall and also you are in a network where you cannot control the router/firewall. The only option is that the client connects to an external server, and you connect to an external server too and let the server to transfer the packets between you and client. Using porth you can achieve this.

Features
=====

- use client certificates
- use one server port for all clients and operators
- connect multiple operators to one client

Build
=====
### Certificates

The certificates can be regenerated by running the following command.

    cd ./tools
    ./keys.sh

### Binaries
    # build server
    cd ./server
    go build
        
    # build client
    cd ./client
    go build
     
    # build operator
    cd ./operator
    go build

Use
=====


Start the server on default port 2671.
    
    ./server/server
    
Redirect port 7000 on client host.

    ./client/client -server=localhost:2671 -local=localhost:7000 -id=testid

Redirect port 7001 on operator host using the same id.

    ./operator/operator -server=localhost:2671 -local=:7001 -id=testid

Now the client port 7000 is accessible from operator host on port 7001.

Server status is available on port 2672.

    curl -i http://localhost:2672/clients
    curl -i http://localhost:2672/server_status
